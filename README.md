# Pomodoro
This project was made by Valentin Patey. 
This project is not supposed to be used and was made in an learning context. 
The objective of this exercice was to learn how to use javascript. 

This project is a "Pomodoro", Pomodoro is a working method that consist in two phases :
- A working phase
- A break phase
You chose a work time X and a break time Y and every X minutes you will have a Y minutes break

To use my Pomodoro, go on this link : https://valentino252004.github.io/Pomodoro/
First chose your work time and break time, press "start" and work. After your work time, you will get a break and after the break time, the work time will start over again.
After pressing "start", the "start" button will become a "reset" button. The reset button reset the timer and the "start" button re-appear. After a reset, you are able to change your work time and break time again, but be careful because this will put you in a new work session.
